 * "Big theory statement"
 *
 * With SMB2 and later, cancel processing may race with the command
 * being cancelled.  When the message ID being cancelled is part of a
 * compound request, and that member of the compound is not active
 * at the time the cancel is processed, then that cancel will not
 * find the request. (a "missed cancel")  We deal with that by
 * keeping track of cancellations in a "scoreboard", and check for
 * a missed cancel when processing SMB2 commands that may block.
 *
 * When we're about to run an SMB2 command (in smb2sr_work) it calls
 * smb2_scoreboard_cmd_start to check whether this message ID has
 * already been cancelled, and if not, mark the ID as "active".
 * If the ID was cancelled, we set the sr_state to CANCELLED and
 * the command-specific handler terminates processing early.
 *
 * The scoreboard itself is a rolling buffer keeping state for
 * message IDs in the range: "oldest" <= ID < "maxid".  Only the
 * "maxid" value is actually stored (in ssn->s_scoreboard_maxid)
 * because "oldest" is simply: maxid - scoreboard_size
 *
 * Each cell in the scoreboard tracks the information about the
 * message ID for the index value: ID & (scoreboard_size - 1)
 * The states in each cell are enum sb_state (below).
 *
 * As new message IDs are received (at "maxid" or beyond) we must
 * "advance the window" represented by the scoreboard, which means:
 *	(a) Updating "maxid" (from old_max to new_max)
 *	(b) re-initializing cells between old_max..new_max
 *
 * Clients may use any message IDs that:
 *	(a) have never been used before, and
 *	(b) are within max_credits of the oldest active ID
 *
 * Within the above constraints, clients may issue commands with
 * message IDs in any sequence.  It's also apparently possible a
 * client may skip message IDs (leaving them forever unused).
 *
 * When we advance the message ID window, we check that there are
 * no commands still active in the range of message IDs that will be
 * less than "oldest" after the advance.  If there are any commands
 * still active in that range, it means the client is trying to use
 * a range of message IDs greater than max_credits, which is a
 * protocol violation and a reason to disconnect the client.

 * The state "unseen" means we have not received this message ID
 * from the client.  The client may use this ID (once) as long as
 * the ID remains within the current message ID window.
 *
 * Note that states: (received, started, cancelled) all imply
 * that we've received a command with that message ID and that
 * the message ID has not yet been "retired".  This is important
 * in relation to other IDs in use because the total range of
 * in-use message IDs is restricted.
 *
 * The states: (done, async) represent message IDs that have been
 * received, processed, and "retired" and should not be reused.
 * The state "async" is a variant of "done" used just to keep
 * track of whether the command completed or "went async".
 * When a command "goes async", it's message ID is "retired".
 * Once a message ID is "retired" (done or aync) it no longer
 * constrains the message ID window.
 *
 * The important state transitions are:
 *
 * unseen -> received
 *	receive a new message ID in some command
 * received -> started
 *	started working on a command (not cancelled)
 * received -> cancelled
 *	command was cancelled before a worker started on it
 * started -> cancelled
 *	command was cancelled while a worker is active on it
 * started -> done
 *	normal command completion
