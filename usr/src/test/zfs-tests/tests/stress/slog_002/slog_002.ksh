# DESCRIPTION:
#	Running multiple copies of dataset_create_write_destroy,
#	dataset_create_write_destroy_attr and dataset_xattr on separate
#	raidz pools. Create new filesystem and write file at the same time.
# 	At the same time, synchronize it every 10 seconds.
#	The system shall not cause the system to fail, hang or panic.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Setup phase will have created several raidz pools each with
#	   a separate intent log.
#	2. Multiple copies of dataset_create_write_destroy are fired off
#	   one per pool in the background.
#	3. Multiple copies of dataset_create_write_destroy_attr are filed off
#	   one per pool in the background.
# 	4. Multiple copies of dataset_xattr are filed off one per pool in the
# 	   background.
#	5. Create three datasets in each pool and start writing files in
#	   background.
#	6. Wait for 30 seconds, then repeat the operation at step 2 - 7.
#	7. Start writing to the same files, making holes in those files in
#	   background.
#	8. Sync every 10 seconds.
#	9. Wait for our stress timeout value to finish, and kill any remaining
#          tests. The test is considered to have passed if the machine stays up
#	   during the time the stress tests are running and doesn't hit the stf
#	   time limit.
