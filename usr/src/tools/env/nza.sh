#       do not bringover from the parent (-n)
#       runs 'make check' (-C)
#       runs lint in usr/src (-l plus the LINTDIRS variable)
#       sends mail on completion (-m and the MAILTO variable)
#       creates packages for PIT/RE (-p)
#       checks for changes in ELF runpaths (-r)
#       build and use this workspace's tools in $SRC/tools (-t)
#
# - This file is sourced by "bldenv.sh" and "nightly.sh" and should not
